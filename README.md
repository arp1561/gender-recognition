# gender-recognition

To manage the test data, add the images in the data folder which is separate for male and female. Then add two csv files to the root directory which contains the path of all female and male images and their labels.

Then run the create_data.py code to create 2 files. One of the images and one of the labels.

Then run recognizer.py to get the answer.

You can change the recognizer file to your needs
